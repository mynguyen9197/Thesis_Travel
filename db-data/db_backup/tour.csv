1;"Thuan Tinh Island - Cooking Tour";5.0;385;906977.0;"Thuan Tinh Island Cooking Tour came from our founder’s, Uncle Thai, love for food, instilled in him by his mother during his childhood in Paris, France. As war refugees, the family of six struggled to survive, knowing little French and having no contacts. Uncle Thai spent his early childhood watching his mother cooking at the restaurant’s kitchen and seeing how much her homemade dishes warm the longing hearts of other immigrants like themselves.With Thuan Tinh Island, Uncle Thai hoped to bring you what he felt decades ago in that little restaurant in Paris – a sense of longing for this country, a genuine love for its food, and most importantly, how a warm bowl of Pho and a crackling sound of Banh xeo can bring the peace and healing you didn’t know you were seeking.Read more";"Cook up a feast of Vietnamese food, including four popular main dishes
